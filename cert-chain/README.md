## Overview
Cert-Chain is a full-stack, decentralized web application for issuing, managing, and verifying tamper-proof certificates using the Soroban smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain.

### 🚀 Production Ready Features
- **Live Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of issued certificates by course.
- **Data Indexing**: Fast off-chain querying utilizing a localized SQLite DB synchronization.
- **Advanced Verification (QR)**: Instantly verify off-chain via embedded certificate QR codes.
- **Enterprise Security**: Rate-limiting, Helmet active security headers.
- **Live Monitoring**: Express Status Monitor mapped to `/status`.

## 📜 Smart Contract Functions

### `issue_cert(env, issuer, cert_hash, student_wallet, course, date)`
- Issues a certificate and stores it on-chain using `cert_hash` as the key
- Requires **issuer wallet auth** (Freighter)
- Panics if the same hash already exists (duplicate prevention)

### `verify_cert(env, cert_hash) → CertInfo`
- Looks up a certificate by its hash
- Returns `{ issuer, student_email, course, date, valid }` 
- No wallet required — public read

### `CertInfo` Struct
```rust
pub struct CertInfo {
    pub issuer: Address,
    pub student_wallet: Address,
    pub course: String,
    pub date: String,
    pub valid: bool,
}
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js `v18+`
- Freighter browser extension (for issuing certs)
- Stellar account with Testnet XLM ([Friendbot](https://friendbot.stellar.org/))
- Rust + `stellar-cli` (for contract re-deployment only)

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd cert-chain
npm install
npm start
# Runs at http://localhost:3000
```

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd cert-chain-backend
# Create .env file:
# BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key_here
npm install
node index.js
# Runs at http://localhost:5000
```

## 🗃️ Data Indexing & Dashboard

When a certificate is issued:
1. Soroban contract stores the cert on-chain, associating it with the Student's Wallet Address.
2. Frontend calls `POST /api/index-cert` on the backend.
3. Backend securely lists this into its robust SQLite database mapping the student's wallet address.
4. The React dashboard instantly pulls the indexed dataset and renders interactive charts using `recharts`!

### 🚀 What's New? (Recent Updates)
- 🏢 **Minimal Enterprise UI:** Complete overhaul removing the previous "vibecoded" aesthetics. Features a sleek, solid dark background, crisp 1px borders, high-contrast typography, and a brand-new professional geometric logo.
- 🖼️ **Live UI Demo**: Check out the stunning new interface in our recent recording:  
  ![UI Demo](./screenshots/demo.webp)
- 🎓 **Detailed Academic Records:** Smart contracts now support passing a designated `grade` to represent a student's performance safely via `scVal`.
- ✏️ **Smart Certificate Modifications:** The Soroban contract introduces an `update_cert` method allowing trusted issuers to fix typographical errors seamlessly.

> **💡 Terminal Logs:** You can monitor the backend SQL injection indexing rate directly via terminal, as well as the `/status` resource monitor mapping server resources.

## 🌟 Example: Successful Issuance

When a certificate is successfully issued and verified, you get a verifiable transaction hash and an automated email confirmation:

**1. Transaction Hash (On-Chain Record):**
```text
TX: KI8YBE7ZX56WNDZMZHNPIVECX4JLUMY9...
```

**2. Backend Index Log:**
```text
✅ Certificate indexed for: GBXUQ...9B
```

**3. Verified Certificate View:**
![Verified Certificate](./certificate.png)

*(Note: Save your uploaded certificate screenshot as `certificate.png` in the project folder to display it here).*

## 🔄 Contract Rebuild & Redeploy

```bash
cd cert-chain/contracts

# Build
stellar contract build

# Deploy to testnet (needs 'alice' identity configured)
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/cert_contract.wasm \
  --source alice \
  --network testnet
```
Update the new Contract ID in `src/utils/constants.js` → `CONTRACT_ID`.
